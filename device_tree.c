/**
 * find_dev_tree(void) - Find the device tree.
 *
 * This API will search multiple partitions looking for a device tree.
 * The search order is:
 * 1.  Look for a partition called device tree.  This would just be the
 *     device tree blob and will not have any associated header.  So whatever
 *     the contents is here is assumed to be a device tree.
 *
 * 2.  Look for an enviroment partition.  This partition may contain a device
 *     tree.  So if we find the partition there may or may not be a device tree
 *     contained within this partition.  Only if the device tree size is
 *     populated in the enviroment structure do we actually say we have a device
 *     tree.
 *
 * 3.  Finally look in the boot partition at the second data section.  The
 *     boot image may have contain a second data section.  Like the enviroment
 *     partition is the size is valid then we assume it to be device tree.
 *
 * Of course the code is not smart enough to actually tell if the data that
 * exists is a device tree.  But patches welcome for differentiation.
 *
 * Returns 0 if the device tree is found or -1 if no device tree is found.
